# Markdown Usage Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It is commonly used in documentation, README files, and web content.

## Basic Syntax
- **Headings**: Use `#` for headings.
  - `# Heading 1`
  - `## Heading 2`
  - `### Heading 3`
- **Bold**: `**bold text**` → **bold text**
- **Italic**: `*italic text*` → *italic text*
- **Bold & Italic**: `***bold and italic***` → ***bold and italic***
- **Lists**:
  - Unordered: Use `-`, `*`, or `+`.
    - `- Item 1`
    - `- Item 2`
  - Ordered: Use numbers followed by a period.
    - `1. First`
    - `2. Second`

## Links and Images
- **Links**: `[Link Text](https://example.com)`
- **Images**: `![Alt Text](image_url)`

## Code and Blocks
- **Inline Code**: Use backticks: `` `code` ``
- **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks for multi-line code:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
